# üè† IoT Project: Smart Home Automation using Raspberry Pi and Telegram Bot ü§ñ

A Project based on implementing home automation using raspberry pi as CPU, Groove pi as Integrating unit, and Telegram Bot as User interaction unit.

We provided the python code which enables the CPU to get instructions from user through Telegram Bot and execute the actions accordingly. And also monitors the surroundings and detectes if any intrusion occured and then passes the alert notification through telegram.

##  Setup

### 1. Raspberry Pi OS Installation
- [Install Raspberry Pi OS](https://downloads.raspberrypi.com/raspios_full_armhf/images/raspios_full_armhf-2024-03-15/2024-03-15-raspios-bookworm-armhf-full.img.xz)
- Write the SD Card using Raspberry Pi OS application.
- Configure a hotspot or Wi-Fi credentials after writing the SD to enable the Raspberry Pi to connect to a network.
- Enable SSH.
- Access Raspberry Pi using SSH.
- Follow this video tutorial for easy setup: [Setup Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-vCFP2jD1g)

### 2. Coding

1. Create a Python file and write the code on the Raspberry Pi.
2. Update the code accordingly and ensure you replace the BOT token ID, Chat ID, and API's token key file path (.json file) correctly.

## Execution

1. Ensure all components are working properly by using some testing codes before running the main code.
2. Verify that every component is connected correctly.
3. Run the Python code in the SSH terminal and test the model.

## Components Required

1. Raspberry Pi
2. Grove Pi
3. Grove LED
4. Ultrasonic Ranger
5. Grove Connectors/Grove Jumpers
6. An SD Card
